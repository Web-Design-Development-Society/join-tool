# Join the organization!

You can just use this [page](https://web-design-development-society.github.io/join-tool/) and we can save 30 minutes every semester

This uses an [wdd-identifier](https://github.com/organizations/Web-Design-Development-Society/settings/applications) OAuth app and [wdd-inviter](https://github.com/organizations/Web-Design-Development-Society/settings/apps) GitHub app. They run on [deno deploy](https://dash.deno.com/) serverless functions.

The GitHub API is so cool!
